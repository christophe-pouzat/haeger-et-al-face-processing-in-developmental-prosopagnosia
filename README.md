# haeger-et-al-face-processing-in-developmental-prosopagnosia

This repository contains supplementary material for Haeger, Pouzat, Luecken, N'Diaye, Elger, Kennerknecht, Axmacher and Dinkelacker (2021) manuscript: " Face Processing in Developmental Prosopagnosia: Altered Neural Representations in the Fusiform Face Area".

Five parts in addition to the present `README` are included:

- `beta_values.h5`: the data in [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) format.
- `analysis_20190308.Rmd`: the analysis "source" file in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) format.
- `analysis_20190308.html`: the `html` output of `analysis_20190308.Rmd` when processed with the free and open-source software [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and its [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) package.
- `analysis_20190308.pdf`: the `pdf` output of `analysis_20190308.Rmd`.
- `TMapsFFA`: EPS visualizations of the t-maps of the FFA clusters derived from the functional localizer, contrasting all faces versus objects and houses with application of a dilated fusiform gyrus mask

The `analysis_20190308.Rmd` file contains a detailed, step by step, explanation of how our "Donsker theorem based statistical test" is applied to the data. Since the data and our codes are available, anyone can check, criticize and improve what we propose.

Readers not familiar with `R` should install the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) package.
